title: 'How to preview Headless CMS changes in development mode'
---

To make local tests, you can use the `dev mode` of the Headless CMS
to see a preview of your changes.

1. After making changes to your FastStore project directory and syncing them with the Headless CMS,
   access the VTEX Admin and navigate to **Storefront > Headless CMS**.
2. Ensure you are in your FastStore project and the server is running.
3. Open the **Developer Tool** or right-click on the page and choose **Inspect**.
4. In the Developer Tool terminal, run the following command:

    ```bash 
    localStorage.setItem('cmsDevMode', 1)
    ```

5. Refresh the page, and you should see the section **Development Mode** in the right sidebar.

6. Click on `Preview`. A new tab will open; copy the link from this tab containing the
   `contentType`, `documentId`, and `versionId`. The link should be similar to the
   following:

    ```
    https://faststore.vtex.app/?contentType=page&documentId=bd9e01d6-534e-4e54-aa76-f864dcbad024&versionId=405118e9-7509-11ed-83ab-0eeee363631w
    ```

7. Now, access the preview link locally and change the parameters accordingly:

    ```
    localhost:3000/api/preview/?contentType=<contentType>&documentId=<DOCUMENT_ID>&versionId=<VERSION_ID>
    ```

> ⚠️ Ensure you replace `<contentType>`, `<DOCUMENT_ID>`, and `<VERSION_ID>` with the actual values from your preview link.

Given the previous example, the local preview link should be the following:

    ```
    localhost:3000/api/preview/?contentType= page&documentId=bd9e01d6-534e-4e54-aa76-f864dcbad024&versionId=405118e9-7509-11ed-83ab-0eeee363631w
    ```

8. Once you have reviewed your changes, terminate the development mode by accessing the Headless CMS page you've changed.
   Open the terminal in the `Developer Tools` and run
   the following:

    ```bash 
    localStorage.removeItem('cmsDevMode')
    ```

9. Refresh the page, and the development mode session will now be ended.
