title: 'Differences between Section Override v1 and v2'
---

Section Override v2 allows you to customize the appearance and functionality of existing components in your store. Compared to v1, v2 offers an adaptable approach. We strongly recommend updating your customization methods to use Section Override v2 in your project.

    > ⚠️ If you choose to continue using Section Override v1, please refer to the [Overriding components (v1)](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-components-and-props-v1).

## Main differences

| Feature                       | Overrides v1                                           | Overrides v2                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overrides per section         | One override per section.                              | Multiple overrides per section.                                       |
| Importing Section             | String passed to `section` key.                        | Section component imported and passed to `Section` key (uppercase S). |
| Native section                | The new component overrides the native one.            | The new component is based on the native one and can coexist with it. |
| Headless CMS property schema  | No customization, limited to native schemas.           | Customizable schema allowing definition of new properties.            |
| Feature availability          | Experimental feature and may not function as expected. | Stable feature.                                                       |

Check out the main differences related to the code syntax:

- Previously, in Section Override v1, you passed the section name as a string to the `section` key within the `getOverriddenSection` method's overrides object:

    ```js
    import { SectionOverride } from "@faststore/core";

    const SECTION = "Alert" as const;

    const override: SectionOverride = {
        section: SECTION,
        components: {
            Alert: { Component: CustomAlert },  
        },
    };

    export { override };
    ```

- Section Override v2 introduces a clearer syntax. Now you import the section component (e.g., `AlertSection` from `@faststore/core`) and pass it to the `Section` key (uppercase `S`) within the overrides object. This emphasizes the component-based approach of v2.

    ```js
    import { AlertSection, getOverriddenSection } from "@faststore/core";  

    const NewAlert = getOverriddenSection({ 
    Section: AlertSection, 
    components: {  
        Alert: { Component: CustomAlert },  
    }, 
    });  

    export default NewAlert;  
    ```

## Updating your project to Section Overrides v2

Make sure your store's `@faststore/core` package is version 3.0.0 or higher to work with Overrides v2. For update instructions, refer to the [release note](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

### Review existing overrides

Identify all overrides currently implemented using Overrides v1 (refer to the [Overrides v1](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-overriding-components-and-props) documentation). Once identified, you can keep these v1 overrides as they will continue to work in your project or create new ones using v2.

    > ⚠️ We strongly recommend using Section Override v2 instead of Section Override v1.

If you wish to maintain existing v1 overrides alongside new v2 overrides, avoid modifying the v1-overridden components. Instead, create new overrides using v2, following the guide on [Overriding a component](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-native-component).
