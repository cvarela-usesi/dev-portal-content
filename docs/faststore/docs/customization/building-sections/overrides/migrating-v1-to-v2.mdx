title: 'Upgrading from Section Override v1 to v2'
---

Section Override v2 allows you to customize the appearance and functionality of existing components in your store. Compared to v1, v2 offers an adaptable approach. We strongly recommend updating your customization methods to use Section Override v2 in your project.

    > ⚠️ If you choose to continue using Section Override v1, please refer to the [Overriding components (v1)](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-components-and-props-v1).

## Main differences

| Feature                       | Overrides v1                                           | Overrides v2                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overrides per section         | One override per section.                              | Multiple overrides per section.                                       |
| Importing Section             | String passed to `section` key.                        | Section component imported and passed to `Section` key (uppercase S). |
| Native section                | The new component overrides the native one.            | The new component is based on the native one and can coexist with it. |
| Headless CMS property schema  | No customization, limited to native schemas.           | Customizable schema allowing definition of new properties.            |
| Feature availability          | Experimental feature and may not function as expected. | Stable feature.                                                       |

Check out the main differences related to the code syntax:

- Previously, in Section Override v1, you defined the override as an object with properties for the section name and component overrides:

    ```js
    import { SectionOverride } from "@faststore/core";

    const SECTION = "Alert" as const;

    const override: SectionOverride = {
        section: SECTION,
        components: {
            Alert: { Component: CustomAlert },  
        },
    };

    export { override };
    ```

- Section Override v2 introduces a more component-centric approach. It directly references the section component (e.g., `AlertSection` from `@faststore/core`) using a dedicated function (`getOverriddenSection`) and builds the override object around it, emphasizing the component being overridden. This shift in v2 promotes clearer code and offers more control during the override creation process.

    ```js
    import { AlertSection, getOverriddenSection } from "@faststore/core";  

    const NewAlert = getOverriddenSection({ 
    Section: AlertSection, 
    components: {  
        Alert: { Component: CustomAlert },  
    }, 
    });  

    export default NewAlert;  
    ```

## Updating your project to Section Override v2

Make sure your store's `@faststore/core` package is version 3.0.0 or higher to work with Section Override v2. For update instructions, refer to the [release note](https://github.com/vtex/faststore/releases/tag/v3.0.0).

### Identify existing overrides (v1)

Identify all overrides currently implemented using Overrides v1 (refer to the [Overrides v1](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-overriding-components-and-props) documentation). Once identified, you can keep these v1 overrides as they will continue to work in your project or create new ones using v2.

    > ⚠️ We strongly recommend using Section Override v2 instead of Section Override v1.

If you wish to maintain existing v1 overrides alongside new v2 overrides, avoid modifying the v1-overridden components. Instead, create new overrides using v2, following the guide on [Overriding a component](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-native-component).
