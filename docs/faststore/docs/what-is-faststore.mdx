excerpt: "The ultimate toolkit for building blazing-fast storefronts."
---

[FastStore](https://github.com/vtex/faststore) is a toolkit based on [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) that helps developers build high-performance stores. 

It supports integration with [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview), offers analytics functionalities to inform storefront decision-making, and gives developers the flexibility to customize the store based on the brandâ€™s vision, creating a unique shopping experience for users.

| Aspect | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Performance** | Ensures fast-loading stores and provides a good user experience, focusing on achieving high scores in tests like [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview) and [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/articles/vitals#core-web-vitals).  |
| **Stability** | Built to be stable and avoid crashes, so your store doesn't lose sales due to provider issues.  |
| **Analytics/SEO** | Works with analytics tools to understand store customers and with SEO tools to improve store visibility in search results. |

  ```

The diagram above shows a FastStore architectural flow, which includes the following components:

  - **Codebase:** Source code of the FastStore project hosted on GitHub.
  - **Build process:** Process of converting the source code into a deployable project through [FastStore WebOps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview).
  - **Deployment:** Process of deploying the project to a production environment through [FastStore WebOps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-overview) and quality assurance bots.
  - **Business user touchpoint:** Environment where admin users interact with storefront settings on VTEX Headless CMS.
  - **Customer touchpoint:** Environment where customers interact with the storefront, in this case, the store website.

### Developer tools
 
These are the tools that developers use to build and deploy FastStore projects. They include:

  - **[FastStore CLI](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-3-faststore-cli):** Command-line interface (CLI) that can be used to interact with FastStore.
  - **[VTEX IO CLI:](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-installation-and-command-reference)** CLI used when the project needs to interact with the VTEX platform.
  - **Localhost preview:** Tool that allows developers to preview their FastStore projects locally.

### Package layer

FastStore consists of five main packages that enable the store to work: 

  - **[Core](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#packagejson):** Provides the starter source code to get your store up and running. It contains four sub-packages: Components, SDK, UI, and API packages.

  - **[SDK](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#packagejson):** Provides developers with a set of tools that handle all meaningful states an ecommerce store might have, such as Session, Cart, Component, and Search. The SDKs also provide GA4-compatible analytics functions to help you create powerful analytics capabilities in your ecommerce store.

  - **[UI](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/components-index):** Gathers the design system based on FastStore components, using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling.

  - **[API](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/faststore-api-overview):** Connects your project to your favorite ecommerce provider by creating interfaces for querying products, collections, and handling carts.

  - **[CLI](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-3-faststore-cli):** Unifies the VTEX source code in `@faststore/core` with the customizations and extensions the store will create in the `/src` folder.

### Technologies
