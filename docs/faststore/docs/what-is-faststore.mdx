## What is FastStore?

[FastStore](https://github.com/vtex/faststore) is a powerful yet lightweight **set of libraries** made for developers who want to explore their knowledge and creativity by building comprehensive and unique ecommerce solutions. It supports integration with Headless CMS, allows meaningful analytics capabilities, and gives developers back the freedom of customization.

### Our philosophy

Instead of focusing on the next big thing in ecommerce, we tend to focus on what will never change and try to nail it well. Our pillars are:

<Steps>

### Performance

Amazing UX with great points on Lighthouse and Web Vitals.

### Stability

Your ecommerce should never lose a sale due to provider issues.

### Analytics/SEO

Understand who's visiting your store and reach a higher organic traffic.

</Steps>

## What is included?

FastStore consists of [five main packages](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#packagejson) that enable the store to work: **FastStore Core**, **FastStore UI**, **FastStore SDK**, and **FastStore API** and **FastStore CLI**:

| Package | Description |
|---------| ------------|
| Core | Provides the starter source code to get your store up and running. It contains four sub-packages: Components, SDK, UI, and API packages. |
| UI | Gathers the design system based on FastStore components, using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styling. |
| SDK | Provides developers with a set of tools that handle all meaningful states an ecommerce store might have, such as Session, Cart, Component, Search. |
| API | Connects your project to your favorite ecommerce provider by creating interfaces for querying products and collections, as well as handling carts. |
| CLI | unifies the VTEX source code in `@faststore/core` with the customizations and extensions the store will create in the `/src` folder. |
