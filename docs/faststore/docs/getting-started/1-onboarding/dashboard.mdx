title: 'FastStore WebOps - Dashboard'
---

Once you have [created your FastStore project](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-starting-the-project#step-2-deploying-the-project) 
or are already working on customizing it, you can use the WebOps Dashboard to have an overview of your website’s deployments and performance.
The WebOps Dashboard gives you a comprehensive overview of website builds and deploy previews, along with suggestions on how to improve your storefront performance based on [Lighthouse scores](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring).

![dashboard-overview](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/dashboard-webops___5bfc079a32f4d0b5facb70dfb3422152.png)

To access the WebOps Dashboard, in the VTEX Admin,go to **Storefront > FastStore WebOps**. The Dashboard has two tabs: [Overview](#overview) and [Integrations](#integrations).

---

## Overview

The Overview tab provides a quick snapshot of your website's key details, including the live store URL, CMS information, and latest deploy.

### Production Overview

The **Production Overview** section provides the following information about the latest deploy of your live store:

| Field                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Live Store**        | URL for your production environment, accessible to shoppers.                                     |
| **Repository**        | GitHub repository associated with the project.                                                   |
| **Deploy**            | Commit for the current deploy, including the date, time, and who made it.                        |
| **CMS Provider**      | Link to [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview). |
| **CMS Project**       | Link to the FastStore project in Headless CMS.                                                   |

This section also displays the status of the live deployment:

- **Success:** The commit was deployed to the production environment and is live.
- **Queued:** The commit is next in line to be deployed.
- **In progress:** The commit is currently being deployed.
- **Failed:** The deployment failed. Further details can be found by clicking the link below the `Deploy` button.

### Lighthouse Scores

When your store goes live (in production), ensuring optimal performance and a good user experience becomes crucial. The Lighthouse Scores section offers insights into four key areas measured by Lighthouse, helping you understand their impact on your store's performance.

- **Performance:** Indicates how fast your pages load.
- **Accessibility:** Reflects how usable your pages are for people with disabilities.
- **Best practices:** Indicates how well your pages adhere to coding best practices.
- **SEO:** Reflects how well your pages are optimized for search engines.

These scores are based on the pages defined for testing in the [Integrations](#integrations) tab.

### Production Deploys

This section lists all the recent deploys to your production store. Each item on the list is composed of the following:

![dashbard-lighthouse-score](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/dashboard-production-deploys___840fcb7b30bc2c7a1e4e5d1d255a58f9.png)

### Preview Deploys

This section lists all the deploy previews created for GitHub branches in your project repository. These previews are automatically available for each pull request opened for a corresponding branch.

## Integrations 

The Integrations tab allows you to configure store pages for Lighthouse Tests. Here, you can specify the URLs for a product listing page (PLP) and a product details page (PDP) to undergo automatic Lighthouse score testing during deployments. This ensures a consistent testing experience.

![dashboard-integrations](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/dashboard-integrations___8575a9f0fc2abfa64bdfc10fc7534e9d.png)

### Configuring pages for Lighthouse testing
To set the pages you want to test with Lighthouse, follow these steps:

1. In the **Default Category for PLP** field, enter the [category](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/what-is-a-category--6HV4Q3E2FauUoOQoiCCgCg) slug defined in the Catalog.
2. In the **Default Product Slug for PDP**, enter the slug for the specific PDP you want to test.
3. Click `Save`.

Once you've set the pages for testing and after a new deploy, go to the **Overview** tab and access the **Lighthouse Scores** section to check the scores for those pages.

| **Deployment**        | Opens the deployed version of the store in a new tab.                                                                                                                                                |
| **Domain**            | Opens the URL of your store's domain, which is the same as the preview.                                                                                                                              |
| **Last commit**       | Displays the most recent commit to your store's repository, including the date, month, year, and the GitHub user who made the commit.                                                                |
| **Status**            | Displays the status of the deployment. For more information on the status values, refer to [Status available values](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard#status-available-values). |

### Status available values

The **Status** field can have one of the following values: 
- `Success`: The deployment was successful. If you want to check the commit associated with it, go to the **Deploys** tab.

- `Error`: An error in the pipeline caused the deploy to fail. To identify the specific step where the error occurred, access the **Deploys** tab and check the last commit. 
Then, access your store repository and verify the pipeline related to that commit. 

  Note that a deploy can fail even if the build process is successful. 
  In this case, even though the code compiled correctly, the deploy may have failed in a specific step of the pipeline.

## Deploys

The **Deploys** section provides a summary of each deployment made in your store's repository.

### Quality checks available values

The **Quality checks** field can have one of the following values:

- `Success`: All checks have passed.

- `Skipped`: In the CI process, specific checks were not performed for certain commits. 
This often occurs when the commit being tested was never the HEAD commit of the main branch, saving time and resources without compromising code quality.

- `Failed`: For more information on the `Failed` status, go to the repository and check what failed in the commit.
