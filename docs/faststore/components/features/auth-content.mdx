title: 'Authenticated content'
---

Authenticated content is a feature that restricts access to specific store content based on whether a user is logged in. This ensures that only registered and logged-in users can view exclusive content, like prices, detailed product descriptions, and special offers. Non-logged-in users will see generic content instead.

Authenticated content fosters a more controlled and secure shopping environment for stores and customers, enhancing the shopping experience. For example, in B2B settings, this allows for customized access to product catalogs, ensuring that businesses only see relevant products and pricing. For segmented promotions, authenticated content enables merchants to tailor special offers and discounts to specific customer segments, increasing engagement and conversion rates.

In this guide, learn how to create an authenticated component using the [Hero](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/organisms-hero) component as an example.

## Before you begin
### Update the `@faststore/core` package

Ensure your store is using `@faststore/core@v3.0.39` or later. To benefit from this feature, follow the steps below:

Update your storeâ€™s `@faststore/core` package to the `v3.0.39` by running the following command:

```bash
yarn add @faststore/core@3.0.39
```

Run `yarn dev` to apply the changes to your project.
