# Authenticated Content Access

This feature allows the access control to ensure that only authenticated users can access content 
ranging from product showcases, texts, links, banners, prices, etc., meeting the demand for security
and customization.

## Overview

Authenticated Content Access is a crucial feature to enhance the user experience in online stores. 
Before and after login, the user experience may differ, especially concerning accessible content 
and prices. This functionality ensures that only authenticated users have access to certain content,
such as prices, detailed product descriptions, and exclusive offers, while displaying generic 
content for non-logged-in users. This not only increases user data security but also provides a 
smoother and more transparent shopping experience. With Authenticated Content Access, online stores
can offer a more controlled and secure environment for their customers, ensuring a satisfactory 
shopping experience.

## Usage

> ‚ö†Ô∏è  This feature is available starting from version 3.0.39 of the @faststore/core package.


<Steps>

### Create a Override Component

Override the component you wish to be visible only when the user is authenticated. 
For further details, please refer to the [Overriding Native Components](/docs/building-sections/overriding-components-and-props) and Props section.

### Wrapp the component with the ProfileChallenge

The @faststore/core package exports the ProfileChallenge component. 
This component takes a child as a prop. 
The child will only be displayed if the user is logged in and has at least one 
Sales Channel configured. For example:

```tsx
import { SectionOverride } from "@faststore/core";
import { ProfileChallenge_unstable as ProfileChallenge } from "@faststore/core/experimental";

import { HeroHeader, HeroImage } from "@faststore/ui";

const SECTION = "Hero" as const;

const override: SectionOverride = {
  section: SECTION,
  components: {
    HeroImage: {
      Component: (props) => (
        <ProfileChallenge>
          <HeroImage {...props} />
        </ProfileChallenge>
      ),
    },
  },
};

export { override };
```

### Create a component Fallback (Optional)

The ```ProfileChallenge``` has a property called ```fallback```. This property is particularly useful when a 
fallback component should be displayed when the user is not logged in. If the fallback is not 
provided, nothing is displayed.

```tsx
import { SectionOverride } from "@faststore/core";
import { ProfileChallenge_unstable as ProfileChallenge } from "@faststore/core/experimental";

import { HeroHeader, HeroImage } from "@faststore/ui";

const SECTION = "Hero" as const;

const override: SectionOverride = {
  section: SECTION,
  components: {
    HeroHeader: {
      Component: (props) => {
        return (
          <ProfileChallenge
            fallback={
              <HeroHeader
                title="üîí Auth Hero"
                subtitle="You should be logged to see this content"
              />
            }
          >
            <HeroHeader {...props} />
          </ProfileChallenge>
        );
      },
    },
  },
};

export { override };

```

</Steps>
