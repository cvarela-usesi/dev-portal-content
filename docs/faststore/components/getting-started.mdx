title: "Getting started with FastStore UI"
---


FastStore UI is an ecommerce-focused library of [brandless](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/using-themes-overview#brandless-and-the-theming-structure) components you can easily use on your application.
It provides features & basic style that makes it faster to implement and customize on top of it.

## Installation

Install `@faststore/ui` as a dependency of your project via the command line:

### yarn

```sh
yarn add @faststore/ui
```

### npm

```sh
npm install @faststore/ui
```

## Adding styles

There are two ways to style FastStore UI components:

- [Overriding a component](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-native-component): Customize a native component.
- [Creating a new section](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-creating-a-new-section): Build a new section for the Headless CMS.

In both scenarios, you'll create a stylesheet for your component and import the necessary styles. For more details on creating a stylesheet and importing styles, refer to the [Importing FastStore UI component styles](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/using-themes-importing-ui-components-styles).

Once you have the stylesheet, import one of the following styles to it:

### All components included

```sh
@import "@faststore/ui/src/styles/components.scss";
```

### Base styles 

```sh
@import "@faststore/ui/src/styles/base.scss";
```
In this case, you should also import the desired components' styles individually by checking the component references to import their styles.
