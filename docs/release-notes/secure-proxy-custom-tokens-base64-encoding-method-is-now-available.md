[Secure Proxy](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/payments-integration-secure-proxy) is a VTEX solution that allows the secure transfer of sensitive data between the VTEX gateway and payment providers that are not [PCI-DSS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/payments-integration-pci-dss-compliance) certified.


## What has changed?

In addition to the data encoding and encryption methods already available in Secure Proxy, you can now create tokens using the [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoding method in your payment transactions at VTEX.

## What needs to be done?

To use the Base64 encoding method in your provider's transactions on Secure Proxy, access [Create custom tokens](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/payments-integration-secure-proxy#create-custom-tokens).
