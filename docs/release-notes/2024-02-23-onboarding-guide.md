## What is the Onboarding Guide?

The Onboarding Guide [introduces]([/link-introdução](https://help.vtex.com/en/tracks/vtex-store-overview--eSDNk26pdvemF3XKM0nK9/3QfoDZWg9YWl8lwS9MVrnU)) a set of documentation tracks covering store architecture planning, configurations for go-live, strategies to enhance your business through product evolution, and guidance on leveraging VTEX support services.
