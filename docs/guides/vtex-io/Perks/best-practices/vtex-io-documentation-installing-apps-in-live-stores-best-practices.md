Once a store is live, worries and uncertainties about security, stability and performance begin to grow.

Without a clear visibility of their potential impact, performing changes that directly affect your store's operation, such as installing new apps, becomes extremely risky. **But it doesn't have to be**.

You can follow best practices to mitigate any loss your store may face - from stability to sales conversion.

Check out some of the best practices below that can and should be adhered to when installing new apps on live stores:

## Best practices

### Running A/B tests

A best practice you certainly must adopt is **A/B testing**.

On VTEX IO, A/B tests are designed entirely for **ecommerce businesses** seeking to improve their conversion rates by comparing and overlaying metrics from two different workspaces.

When installing a new app on your store, we strongly recommend you to install it on a Production workspace and then compare this workspace with the Master workspace by [running an A/B test](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-running-native-ab-testing).

But note: during the A/B test configuration, it is strongly recommended that you **manually set traffic for each workspace**.

>⚠️ The VTEX IO A/B test allows traffic to be directed either manually or automatically. In the latter scenario, the platform initially segments your store's total traffic and directs 50% of it to the Production workspace undergoing testing and the remaining 50% to the Master workspace. While it has considerable advantages for the store's conversion rate, automatically segmenting traffic may also pose greater operational risks by potentially impacting a greater number of users.

### Performing manual tests

In addition to the platform's A/B test, you can also manually adopt best practices for testing new apps in Development workspaces using the `vtex link` command.

Before installing a new app on a store's Production or Master workspace, go through the steps described below:

1. Firstly, [install](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-installing-an-app) the desired app in the account you are working in using a Development workspace;
2. [Link](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-linking-an-app) your local files with the VTEX IO platform;
3. Access the store in which you are working from the Development workspace in which the app was installed. For example: `{developmentWorkspaceName}--{accountName}.myvtex.com`;
4. Navigate the store and test to see whether its behavior is as expected after installing the new app;
5. You can also access the store from its master workspace (`{accountName}.myvtex.com`) to check for any behavioral regression while the app is not yet installed;
6. Once all was tested, install the app on a [Production workspace](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-creating-a-production-workspace);
7. Finally, [promote the Production workspace to Master](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-promoting-a-workspace-to-master) and make the new configurations public for all your users.
