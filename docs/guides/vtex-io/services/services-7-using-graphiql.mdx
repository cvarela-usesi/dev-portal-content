Now that you've implemented the GraphQL query and its resolver, it's time to put it to the test using [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql), an in-browser GraphQL IDE. Follow the steps below to efficiently experiment with your GraphQL queries.

## Accessing the GraphiQL IDE

Navigate to the GraphQL route prompted in the terminal after linking your app. The GraphiQL interface consists of three main areas: the coding area, the query variables area, and the debug area, as illustrated below.

```sh Terminal mark=8

```

## Writing the query

In the coding area, enter the GraphQL query provided in the right panel. This query is designed to retrieve information about the `topN` most viewed products, including their `slug` (product identifier) and `count` (number of views).

```graphql Query
query ($topN: Int) {
 productList(topN: $topN){
   slug
   count
 }
}
```

---

## Using query variables

Since the declared query involves a variable (`topN`), declare it in the _Query Variables_ area located beneath the coding area. You can expand this area by dragging its title.

```json QueryVariables
{
 "topN": 2
}
```

---

## Running the query

Click the `Play` button to execute the code, and check the outcome in the debug area.

```json Response

  "data": {
    "productList": [
      {
        "slug": "1920",
        "count": 7
      },
      {
        "slug": "1234",
        "count": 5
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
