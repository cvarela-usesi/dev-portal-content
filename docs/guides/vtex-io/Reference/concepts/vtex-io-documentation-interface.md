Interfaces establish a relation between a block and a React component, allowing the Store Builder to build the store's frontend. They can be found within an app's `interfaces.json` file.

For every exported block, the app also defines a React component linked to that block. For example:

```json
// product-summary/store/interfaces.json
{
  "product-summary": {
    "component": "ProductSummary",
    "composition": "children",
    "content": {
      "$ref": "app:vtex.product-summary#/definitions/ProductSummary"
    }
  }
}
```

In general, frontend apps export different blocks, which are declared and configured in the Store Theme's code, and React components related to these blocks. These components are then rendered on the store's frontend.
