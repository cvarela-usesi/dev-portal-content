Workspaces are environments isolated from each other in terms of app development. They can be understood as different versions of the same VTEX account. In practice, changes performed in a particular workspace do not affect your store's live version or other developers' work.

> ℹ️ If you're used to working with git, think of workspaces as branches.

There are three main types of workspaces:

- **Development workspace** - is mainly used by software developers to draft, build or extend VTEX IO apps and storefront themes. These workspaces provide more development freedom. They allow [linking](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-linking-an-app), [installing](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-installing-an-app), and [publishing](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-publishing-an-app) VTEX IO apps. They can't handle production traffic, be promoted to master, nor be used for A/B testing.
- **Production workspace** - is mainly used by the quality assurance and development teams to validate VTEX IO apps. These workspaces support production traffic and can be used for [A/B testing](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-running-native-ab-testing), but linking apps is forbidden. If desired, these workspaces can be [promoted to master](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-promoting-a-workspace-to-master) to become publicly available for all end-users.
- **Master workspace** - a **unique** production workspace that reflects the content served to the end-users of a store.

Development and production workspaces can be accessed at `https://{workspace}--{account}.myvtex.com`.

> ⚠ While each workspace operates independently when it comes to app development, they share the same VTEX platform modules accessible through Admin. Then, any changes made in a specific workspace will be reflected in all others.
