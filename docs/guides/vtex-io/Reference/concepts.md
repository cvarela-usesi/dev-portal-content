## [Billing Options](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-billing-options)

Configure your app's **billing options** to distribute your application in the VTEX ecosystem. Define an appâ€™s distribution on the platform and structure its pricing data, allowing the application usage to be public and, in some scenarios, even charged.

## [Builders](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders)

Learn how to use **builders**. A VTEX IO abstraction that works as an API service responsible for processing and interpreting a directory in your app.

## [Clients](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-clients)

Create and configure **Clients** to abstract communications of a given system

## [CMS](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-cms)

Use the **CMS** to manage your storefront.

## [Dependencies](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-dependencies)

Declare **dependencies**in your app's *manifest* file to specify which VTEX IO apps your app relies on to properly work.

## [Edition App](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-edition-app)

An **Edition App**consists of a bundle of settings, policies, backend and frontend apps encapsulated and exported by a *Sponsor Account.*

## [Interfaces](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-interface)

**Interface**is what links a block to a React component.

## [Manifest](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-manifest)

The `manifest.json` file is the first communication point with VTEX IO, holding important metadata about an app, such as its name, version, vendor, description, dependencies, etc.

## [Peer Dependencies](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-peerdependencies)

Declare **peer dependencies** in your app's *manifest* file to specify which VTEX IO apps that must not be automatically installed in an account your app relies on to properly work.

## [Policies](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-policies)

**Policies** are a set of permissions granted to a *resource* (VRN) or a *role* that allows or forbids them to execute a given set of actions in an account, such as performing a request to the platform.

## [Roles](ref:roles)

**Roles** are uniquely identifiable names given to request sources.

## [Routes](/docs/guides/routes)

A **route** maps a URL pattern and an HTTP request method to an action. It's, therefore, a way of setting the application expected behavior for client requests to specific endpoints. Check this concept to find out how VTEX IO handles routing.

## [Slots](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-slots)

**Slots** composition is a new way to declare a React component in your Store Theme code.

## [Sponsor Account](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-sponsor-account)

A **Sponsor Account**is a VTEX account responsible for the development and release of the *Edition App* installed in its child accounts.

## [VTEX IO CLI](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-toolbelt)

**VTEX IO CLI** is a command-line interface that gives you access to every feature of the VTEX platform.

## [VTEX Resource Name (VRN)](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-vrn)

A **VTEX Resource Name (VRN)** is how the VTEX IO platform expresses the resource path called in a request.

## [Workspace](/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-workspace)

**Workspaces** are work spaces isolated from one another.
