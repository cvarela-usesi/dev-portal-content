When comparing two or more online stores, we can notice similarities in their structure. For instance, regardless of the store, it's common to see products highlighted in the window display, a search bar, menus, product pages with a buy button, a logo, etc.

These commonalities suggest that **online store components are intertwined**, and this makes the process of creating a store easier.

Frontend development can be done using a **single, shareable component structure** among stores, and this is where Store Framework comes into play.

## Delivering the foundation needed for any storefront structure

The VTEX Store Framework is built on the [VTEX IO development platform](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-io) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) technology, and it is responsible for building the storefront by offering native ecommerce components in JSON format.

Our components allow you to:

- Build your store frontend in the **fastest possible go-to-market**.
- Have **comprehensive shopping experiences** that never get old.
- Adapt these experiences to match your store's unique identity since they are highly **flexible** and allow for **high customization**.
- Enjoy native **integration with VTEX APIs**.
- Easily track your store view events through **analytic tools**, such as Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics.
- Connect and collaborate with other developers, ask questions and share your knowledge at the VTEX Community.
- **Standardize the way your team develops** frontend code.
