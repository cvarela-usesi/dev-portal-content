While the VTEX IO platform and Store Framework provide high-quality and customizable React storefront blocks, there may be cases where you require specific frontend solutions not covered by our native components. In such cases, the VTEX IO platform empowers you to create your own storefront apps with [React](https://reactjs.org/). 

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build React storefront components using the VTEX IO platform. This tutorial comprises nine parts covering all aspects of the development process, from setting up your development environment to making your app publicly available. 

Here's an overview of the parts:

The storefronts apps you develop can be used in your store's theme or be made available to other stores interested in the same solution through [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/). During the development process, make sure to follow our [best practices on developing custom storefront components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-developing-custom-storefront-components) and [App Store Guidelines](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-homologation-requirements-for-vtex-app-store) to ensure the best results.

> ⚠️ Please note that custom apps are the liability of the [app's vendor](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-manifest#vendor), and VTEX shall bear no responsibility for these apps nor provide support for their users.
