In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a custom integration with a third-party solution by developing your own [**Pixel app**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-pixel-app).

Pixel apps are responsible for running scripts on all pages of a store website. You can use them to load JavaScript resources into your web pages and extend the core functionalities of your website.

## Before you begin

Before taking this tutorial, check our [list of Pixel apps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/pixel-apps/) and make sure the integration you're looking for is not already available.

Also, if you're wondering whether to **create a Pixel app** or **customize an HTML tag with Google Tag Manager**, keep in mind that the first option is always the most recommended. Creating a new app allows for more freedom during development and may also help other users interested in the same solution.
