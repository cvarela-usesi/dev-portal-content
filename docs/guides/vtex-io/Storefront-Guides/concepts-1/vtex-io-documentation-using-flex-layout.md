Since [**Flex Layout**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-using-flex-layout) is a structure that allows the construction of custom layouts according to the concept of **rows** and **columns**, it basically can be used to build any desired store page.

In this recipe, we will learn how to use it in a practical case, building an **About Us** page from scratch just as the one below:

If we think on how we could divide this page layout, we realize that it could be easily thought of as a "one row with two columns" model:

To achieve the layout shown above, we must use the `flex-layout.row` and `flex-layout.col` blocks, which are going to define each row and column in the page layout and their children blocks.

## Declaring the `flex-layout.row`

First, let's declare (in the `blocks` folder or `blocks.jsonc` file) the main block for the entire About Us page:

```json
"store.custom#about-us": {
  "blocks": [
    "flex-layout.row#about-us"
  ]
},
```

As you can see, the `store.custom#about-us` block consists of a single `flex-layout.row` block, because it is always the highest order block in the `flex-layout`. You should never use the `flex-layout` block directly.

## Defining the `flex-layout.row` and declaring the `flex-layout.col`

Now that we declared that we are going to use `flex-layout.row#about-us`, let's in fact define it:

```json
"store.custom#about-us": {
  "blocks": [
    "flex-layout.row#about-us"
  ]
},
"flex-layout.row#about-us": {
  "children": [
    "image#mobile-phone",
    "flex-layout.col#text-about-us"
  ]
},
```

> The `flex-layout.row#about-us` block is going to display its child dependencies in an interface, from left to right, one after the other.

As shown above, the `flex-layout.row#about-us` was declared with two child blocks, one of them being an `image` and the other a `flex-layout.col` block. Both `flex-layout` blocks only accept blocks allowed by their parent.

## Defining the `flex-layout.col`

Let's define our `flex-layout.col#text-about-us` block:

```json
"store.custom#about-us": {
  "blocks": [
    "flex-layout.row#about-us"
  ]
},
"flex-layout.row#about-us": {
  "children": [
    "image#mobile-phone",
    "flex-layout.col#text-about-us"
  ]
},
"flex-layout.col#text-about-us": {
  "children": [
    "rich-text#title-about-us",
    "rich-text#about-us"
  ],
  "props": {
    "blockClass": "textColumn",
    "preventVerticalStretch": true
  }
},
```

> The `flex-layout.col#text-about-us` block is going to display its child dependencies in an interface, from top to bottom, one after the other.

The `preventVerticalStretch` prop prevents the column from occupying 100% of its parent's height when set as `true`. You can use other custom row props, which can be found in the [Flex Layout documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-flex-layout/).

### Final results

Here is the final `about-us.json` file using Flex Layout:

```json
{
  "store.custom#about-us": {
    "blocks": ["flex-layout.row#about-us"]
  },
  "flex-layout.row#about-us": {
    "children": ["image#mobile-phone", "flex-layout.col#text-about-us"]
  },
  "flex-layout.col#text-about-us": {
    "children": ["rich-text#title-about-us", "rich-text#about-us"],
    "props": {
      "blockclass": "textColumn",
      "preventVerticalStretch": true
    }
  },
  "rich-text#title-about-us": {
    "props": {
      "text": "# Create meaningful and relevant experiences.",
      "blockClass": "title"
    }
  },
  "image#mobile-phone": {
    "props": {
      "src": "https://storecomponents.vteximg.com/files/mobile-phone.png",
      "maxHeight": "",
      "maxWidth": "",
      "blockClass": "storePrint"
    }
  },
  "rich-text#about-us": {
    "props": {
      "text": "**Optimized store framework** \n Free your frontend with our React + Node store framework.

      "blockClass": "about"
    }
  }
}
```

## Rules and recommendations

- Each row and column can have as **many levels as needed**.
- When creating levels, it is necessary to **alternate between rows and columns**. Within a row, you can only place columns, and within columns, only rows.
- Be mindful about the structure that you set in your flex layout does not only affect your code organization, but also reflects in the way that blocks will be shown and managed through the Site Editor admin. Therefore, it is always important to **take the organization of both code and Site Editor into account when planning to apply the Flex Layout** onto a page.
