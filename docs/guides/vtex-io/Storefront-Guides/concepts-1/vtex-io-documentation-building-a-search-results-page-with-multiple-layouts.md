Your results presentation on the search results page doesn't need to be always the same for your users: thanks to enhancements in the Search Result app, you can provide them a more **customized experience** to navigate between the fetched products.

Note that the search results page above works with two different layouts: `grid` and `list`.

The flexibility to offer multiple layouts, which can help the sales tax rates by enhancing the shopping experience, is at hands! Check out the step-by-step section below.

> ⚠️ To obtain successful results with this recipe, it is strongly recommended to understand previously how the [Flex Layout](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.flex-layout) and the [Search Result](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.search-result) apps work. We also advise you to go through the [Building a Horizontal Product Summary recipe](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-building-a-horizontal-product-summary) to achieve similar results on your search results page.

## Step by step

1. Implement the Search Result app in your Store Theme according to the instructions in the [documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/apps/vtex.search-result/).
2. Declare the `gallery` block responsible for structuring the page layout, use its `layouts` prop to define the desired layouts for the search results page. For example:

    ```json
    "gallery": {
      "props": {
        "layouts": [
          {
            "name": "grid",
            "component": "GridSummary",
            "itemsPerRow": {
              "(min-width:1008px)":4,
              "(min-width:623px) and (max-width:1007px)":3,
              "(max-width:622px)":2
            }
          },
          {
            "name": "list",
            "component": "ListSummary",
            "itemsPerRow": 1
          }
        ],
        "ListSummary": "product-summary.shelf#listLayout",
        "GridSummary": "product-summary.shelf"
      }
    }
    ```

    Notice that all of the `layouts`'s three properties are mandatory and must be provided for each layout.

    | Property      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
    | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `name`        | specifies the search result layout. It can be `grid` or `list`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
    | `component`   | Defines the parent block responsible for defining the layout's components. For the `grid` layout, we define the component `GridSummary` that will then present items vertically and horizontally from each other. For the `list` layout, we define the `ListSummary` to show a list of items below one another. |
    | `itemsPerRow` | controls how many items per row will be displayed by each layout. You can use media queries to define the layouts' widths properties for desktop, tablet, and phone, such as `min-width` and `max-width`, or you can use the layouts' name, such as `desktop`, `tablet` and `phone`.                            |

    Choosing to use the layouts' name, such as `desktop`, `tablet` and `phone`, in `itemsPerRow`, you should declare them as the example below:

    ```json
    {
      "component":"GridSummary",
      "itemsPerRow":{
        "desktop":4,
        "tablet":3,
        "phone":2
      }
    }
    ```

    Once you define the `list` and `grid` layouts, declare which blocks you should use in the code to build the desired pages:

    | Component     | Block                                    |
    | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
    | `ListSummary` | `product-summary.shelf#listLayout` block |
    | `GridSummary` | `product-summary.shelf` block            |

3. Define the default layout i.e. which layout will be first presented to your users using the `defaultGalleryLayout` prop, from the `search-result-layout.mobile` and `search-result-layout.desktop` blocks:

    ```json
    "search-result-layout.desktop": {
      "children": [
        "flex-layout.row#searchbread",
        "flex-layout.row#searchtitle",
        "flex-layout.row#result"
      ],
      "props": {
        "pagination": "show-more",
        "preventRouteChange": false,
        "defaultGalleryLayout": "grid"
      }
    }
    ```

    > ℹ️ Until now, you have a functioning search page with multiple layouts but with no flexibility to switch between them. For this purpose, we are going to declare next the `gallery-layout-switcher` block.

4. Declare the `gallery-layout-switcher` block in the search results template (`store.search`):

    ```jsonc
    "gallery-layout-switcher": {
      "children": [
        /*
          * For accessibility purposes, it is fundamental to define the layout options following the same ordering used to declare them in step 2.
          */
        "gallery-layout-option#grid",
        "gallery-layout-option#list"
      ]
    },
    "gallery-layout-option#grid": {
      "props": {
        "name": "grid"
      },
      "children": [
        "icon-grid",
        "responsive-layout.desktop#textOptionGrid"
      ]
    },
    "gallery-layout-option#list": {
      "props": {
        "name": "list"
      },
      "children": [
        "icon-inline-grid",
        "responsive-layout.desktop#textOptionList"
      ]
    },
    "responsive-layout.desktop#textOptionGrid": {
      "children": [
        "rich-text#option-grid"
      ]
    },
    "responsive-layout.desktop#textOptionList": {
      "children": [
        "rich-text#option-list"
      ]
    },
    "rich-text#option-grid": {
      "props": {
        "text": "Grid",
        "textColor": "c-auto",
        "blockClass": "layout-option"
      }
    },
    "rich-text#option-list": {
      "props": {
        "text": "List",
        "textColor": "c-auto",
        "blockClass": "layout-option"
      }
    }
    ```

    > ℹ️ As seen above, each `gallery-layout-option` block receives the `name` prop with the name of the layout it corresponds to - this is a **mandatory** prop. In addition to this, you can also declare other blocks as its children and customize the selected layout option using the `galleryLayoutOptionButton--selected` [CSS Handle](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-using-css-handles-for-store-customization/).

5. Add the `gallery-layout-switcher` block as a child of the `search-result-layout.mobile` and `search-result-layout.desktop` blocks to display the switcher button on the page for both devices (mobile and desktop). For example:

    ```json
    "flex-layout.row#searchinfo": {
      "children": ["flex-layout.col#productCount", "flex-layout.row#orderByAndSwitcher"]
    },
    "flex-layout.row#orderByAndSwitcher": {
      "children": ["order-by.v2", "gallery-layout-switcher"],
      "props": {
        "horizontalAlign": "right",
        "preventHorizontalStretch": true,
        "blockClass": "orderByAndSwitcher",
        "colGap": 3
      }
    }
    "flex-layout.col#switcherMobile": {
      "children": ["gallery-layout-switcher"],
      "props": {
        "verticalAlign": "middle"
      }
    }
    ```
