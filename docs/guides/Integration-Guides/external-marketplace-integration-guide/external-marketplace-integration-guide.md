In our native multi-seller architecture, VTEX stores decouple different aspects of an ecommerce operation in order to clearly divide responsibilities between marketplace and seller.

This allows VTEX stores to become marketplaces themselves or become sellers in other VTEX stores without requiring any additional development. Store settings connect the marketplace subsystem of a store to the seller subsystem of another.

This behavior can be leveraged in endless combinations. VTEX accounts can both set up a marketplace storefront to sell products from multiple sellers, including their own, and distribute products to multiple other marketplaces. This creates our [collaborative commerce](https://vtex.com/en/blog/strategy/collaborative-commerce-imperative-why-digital-first-collaboration-is-at-the-core-of-todays-business-success/) network.

However, there may be a strategic partner for your business operating outside our collaborative commerce network. This guide presents the steps needed to develop a **custom connector to sell your products in an external marketplace**.
