Now that we have successfully implemented the Analytics client, our next goal is to leverage events fired by the `events-example` app as triggers for requests to the Analytics client. This approach ensures that with every event received, we make a corresponding request to the Analytics client, resulting in updated data for live product visualizations every 3 seconds.

## Using the Analytics client as a event handler

As the Analytics client is already implemented, we can use it in our event handler function. First, in the `service-course-template/node/event/liveUsersUpdate.ts` file, import the client we implemented in the previous step and the `EventContext` from the `@vtex/api` package to access the Analytics client that is within the `ctx` object. Finally, use the `getLiveUsers()` method the Analytics client implements and log the fetched data.

```ts service-course-template/node/event/liveUsersUpdate.ts
import { Clients } from '../clients/index'
import { EventContext } from '@vtex/api'

export async function updateLiveUsers(ctx: EventContext<Clients>) {
    const liveUsersProducts = await ctx.clients.analytics.getLiveUsers()
    console.log('LIVE USERS: ', liveUsersProducts)
    return true
}
```

## Linking the app

Run `vtex link`. For every event fired, you should see the live users retrieved from the Analytics client.

```sh Terminal
