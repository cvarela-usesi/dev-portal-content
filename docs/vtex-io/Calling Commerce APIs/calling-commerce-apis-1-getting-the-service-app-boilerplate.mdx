To exercise the concepts learned in this course, it is necessary that you have the `vtex.service-example` app available locally, also used in the [Services course](https://learn.vtex.com/docs/course-service-course-lang-en).

So, if you don't already have this application on your computer:

1. Clone the `vtex-apps/service-example` repository by inserting on a terminal the command:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vtex-apps/service-example
   ```
2. Inside the app folder, run `vtex link` to check if the app builds normally. You should receive a link to a public route that the code exposes.

## Project structure

The project has many files and directories, but we will use only some of them in this course. The ones we will use are shown below.

```
service-example
├── manifest.json
├── node
│   ├── middlewares
│   │   ├── validate.ts
│   │   └── status.ts
│   ├── clients
│   │   └── index.ts
```

- **manifest.json**: Manifest of the app containing various informations including vendor, app name, version, dependencies, builders, policies, etc.
- **node**: Folder where is located the TypeScript code that runs on NodeJS runtime. Every app that uses the `node` builder will have this folder containing the files that will run with this builder.
- **middlewares**: Folder with the TypeScript middlewares. They are functions that are used to process a request made through a route exposed by the service. The routes of the service, which middlewares are used in each route, and the order in which the middlewares are called are defined in the `node/index.ts` file (do not confuse with the `node/clients/index.ts` file).
- **validate.ts**: Middleware that validates if the request has a valid HTTP status code. It will also be used to access the app authentication token.
- **status.ts**: Middleware to call the VTEX Commerce API. In this example, it will display the SKU details from the Catalog.
- **clients**: Folder where the Clients of the app are defined, which are used to access resources external to the app.
- **index.ts**: Definition of the `Clients` class. Here we will import the Client `Catalog` and define a getter/setter function for Catalog items.
